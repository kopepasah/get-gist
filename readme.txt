A simple WordPress plugin that adds a gist shortcode for getting a single Gist and the files within.

== Description ==

A simple WordPress plugin that adds a gist shortcode for getting a single Gist and the files within. It uses the Gist V3 API. Has the option for authentication via Personal Access Token. 

__Usage__
Get a Gist using a WordPress shortcode: `[gist id=00000000 file=file-name.php]`

The Gist will return as plain text. I recommend using WordPress plugin Syntaxhighlighter Evolved to highlight the Gist. See below for details.

Visit [Get Gist on Github](http://https://github.com/kopepasah/get-gist “Get Gist”) for more options and information.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `get-gist` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add your Github API key on the plugins settings page (optional)
